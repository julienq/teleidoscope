Teleidoscope
============

This is an adaptation of the [LLVM
tutorial](http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/index.html) demonstrating how to
implement the Kaleidoscope language. The difference here is that the compiler
is written in C instead of C++, and that the target is
[asm.js](http://asmjs.org/) instead of LLVM.
